# Data Vision

Thanks for checking out Data Vision! This is a Python desktop application designed for comprehensive statistical data analysis. It offers a range of features for measuring central tendency, dispersion, distribution, and performing correlation analysis. Plus, it generates insightful graphs to help you visualize your data.

## Overview

### Measuring Central Tendency and Dispersion

Data Vision helps you understand the core characteristics and spread of your data. You can calculate:

- **Mean**: Get the arithmetic, harmonic, or geometric average of your data.
- **Mode**: Find the most frequently occurring value.
- **Median**: Identify the middle value when your data is ordered.
- **Range**: See the spread of your data by finding the difference between the highest and lowest values.
- **Coefficient of Variance**: Compare the variability of different datasets.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure how much your data typically deviates from the mean.
- **Variance**: Calculate the average of the squared differences from the mean, showing data spread.
- **Quartile**: Divide your data into four equal parts to understand its distribution and spread.

### Measuring Distribution

Explore the distribution patterns of your data with:

- **Poisson Distribution**: Ideal for modeling the occurrence of rare events over a specified period or space.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Use this to model the probability of success or failure in a series of independent trials.
- **Normal Distribution**: Apply this to data that naturally clusters around a central value, forming a bell curve.

### Correlation Analysis

Data Vision allows you to analyze the correlation between two datasets, helping you understand how they relate to each other.

### Graphs

Visualize your data effectively with automatically generated graphs, including:

- **Bar Graphs**
- **Line Graphs**
- **Scatter Plots**

The graphs are created using the Matplotlib library.

## Technologies Used

Data Vision is built with Python, leveraging powerful libraries and frameworks for its statistical and graphing capabilities:
